              Hello guys and welcome to my webpage. This webpage is not only about me but also can guide you along the way.
              I hope this webpage helps you along the way. I am 14 year old teenager who loves coding and aspires to become a professional coder. You can check out all my
              projects in the github link on the navbar. I have written a discord bot but have absolutly no idea how to publish it.

              For those who don't know github is a place where one can upload and save their code more like a cloud. It is also helps in hosting your webpages like mine.
              I love coding and maths and want to learn more about it. I know a bunch of languages like Java, Python, HTML and CSS. Python is much easier for coding in syntax
              and is way better, but if you want to learn object oriented programming, Java is the best way to learn it and even Minecraft is entirely based on it.
              What is the point of learning coding, you might ask? For that, well that it is your choice. It is an amazing place to be in, it impliments all the thing that you
              have learnt including physics, maths and even bio. There is another complete section for graphic art and design and it is growing section in our world.
              We are rushing towards advanced technology and we are becoming better at it.
