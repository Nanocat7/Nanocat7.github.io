Java was the first language I learned. It was a comperatively harder language to that of Python. But as you start learning you will get used to it. Everyone starts with this simple code.

{% highlight java %}
    public class firstProject{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }
    // Prints "Hello World!" to output
{% endhighlight %}

That was the beginning of it. From then it went from Scanner, Integers, Arrays and ArrayLists. I have many projects in java (I haven't posted them on github.). Then next I went to 
GUI. GUI is very inefficient in java. You have to write about 100 lines of code to make a button or a text box to type. Don't get me wrong, Java is a beautiful language and it is 
amazing for backend. Many backend programs are still based on java and many languages are still based on java. For example Scala. It is an Object Oriented Programming Language and 
according to me, I think it is the best language to learn OOPs. For GUI python pyGame and in javascript Electron is the best. It is an amazing language all in all.
